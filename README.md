## Business problem statement
Small businesses are the backbone of the U.S. economy, driving job creation and innovation. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) plays a vital role in supporting these businesses by providing loan guarantees. However, approving these loans can be a complex process, requiring lenders to balance the need to support small businesses with the risk of default.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to assist lenders in the SBA loan approval process. The model will be trained on historical data to predict the likelihood of a loan being repaid (approved) or defaulting (denied). This will enable lenders to make more informed decisions, promoting responsible lending practices while facilitating access to capital for qualified small businesses.

This approach offers several potential benefits:

**Increased Efficiency:** Streamline loan assessment by providing a data-driven prediction of loan success.  
**Reduced Risk:** Improve loan portfolio quality by identifying high-risk applications.  
**Greater Access to Capital:** Allow lenders to confidently approve loans for qualified small businesses that might otherwise be denied.
